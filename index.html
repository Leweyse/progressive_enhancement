                <h2>The story</h2>
                <p class="1st-para">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate</q>. The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe</q>. The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Maybe</q>.</p>

            <article class="paragraph">
                <p class="2nd-para">The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark></q>, and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe</q>. The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe</q>.</p>

                    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.</p>
